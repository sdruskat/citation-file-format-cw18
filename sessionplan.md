# Workshop outcomes:

1. Participants will learn about CFF and how to make software easily citable by
providing a CFF file.
2. I will learn what participants think about CFF, its potential and its issues,
and whether they think its an effort wortwhile continuing.

# Session plan (17:15 - 17:50) -- 35 mins.

1. Introduction 8 (8)
2. Activity 8 (16)
3. Discussion 5 (21)
4. Input 5 (26)
5. Deepening 7 (33)
6. Synthesis 2 (35)

## 1. Introduction - 10 (10)

### Summary

1. Introduce facilitator & workshop notes - 2 mins
2. Introduce CFF history - 1 min
3. Introduce CFF features - 2 min
4. Introduce CFF structure - 2 min
5. Introduce CFF tooling - 2 min
6. Introduce CFF uptake

### Learning Goal

1. Learn about CFF

## 2. Activity: Creating CFF files - 8 (18)

### Summary

1. Introduce activity and split group into pairs

- Every pair should create a CITATION.cff file for a software of their choice,
real software or fictional software (optional pull request on the project after 
the session, with note to correct information), basic information is a must,
additional info is great
- Starting points can be:
	- Example in the Notes document (display on slide)
	- The doi2cff tool
	- Complete schema example

### Learning Goal

1. Enable participants to provide software citation metadata in CITATION.cff files

## 3. Discussion: Can software be made easily citable with CFF? - 5 (23)

### Summary

A plenary discussion of how people found this exercise, what they noticed in discussing with their partner.

Guided by the following questions:
* How easy was it to provide citation metadata for your exemplary software?
* How accessible have you found the documentation?
* What could have helped you making the provision process easier?
* Have you found omissions in the format specifications, e.g., metadata that hasn't been addressed?
* What do you think can be done with the provided metadata?

### Learning Goal

1. Understand the features and structure of CFF
2. Discover any benefits of the format
3. Discover shortcomings, omissions, issues in the specs

## 4. Deepening: CFF and CodeMeta - 5 (28)

### Summary

1. Introduce CodeMeta briefly
2. Define key differences (enforcement of principles & citation-centricity, human-readability)
3. Introduce options: 
	1. Let CFF die (what will happen to the community, what will happen to my PhD?)
	2. Transform CFF into codemeta.yaml (exact same keys)
	3. Provide tooling so that the two remain compatible, and develop under the "healthy competition of tools" principle

### Learning Goal

1. Learn about the issue of parallel development of CFF and CodeMeta

## 5. Input: Discussion on how to shape the relationship of CFF and CodeMeta - 5 (33)

### Summary

1. General discussion of how CFF should be aligned with CodeMeta

### Learning Goal

1. Find a suitable way to resolve the parallel existence and development of two metadata formats for software

## 6. Synthesis: What have we learned - 2 (35)

### Summary

Talk about what happened in the session, some of the results of the discussion, what issues were discussed, 
what solutions were made, and give some more time for participants to ask more questions before the session is closed.

### Learning Goal

1. Enable participants to clarify any areas of confusion.
